How to run benchmarks:

First, run:
	$ bench/new <ext2|linux-ext2|linux-ext3> [OPTIONAL_NAME]
This creates tests/DATE, symlinks test to tests/DATE, and populates
several files describing the current kudos system.
You will run new each time you change the system. You can then compare
systems by comparing their tests/DATE/ contents.

Then run a test(s):
	$ bench/tar
	$ bench/rm (run this after tar)
	$ bench/postmark
These will make kudos, init and mount the fs, load kudos, run the test,
and shutdown. Application output is logged to test/TESTNAME.run.N
and kernel output is logged to test/TESTNAME.sys.N.

There are three tests which run other tests:
	$ bench/tar_rm
	$ bench/multi <NRUNS> <PROGRAM> [ARGS...]
	$ bench/all [OPTIONAL_NRUNS]
tar_rm runs bench/tar and then bench/rm.
multi runs a given test multiple times.
all runs all our tests, (multiple times) to measure time performance
and once to measure memory usage (TESTNAME-mem.*).
