Chris,
  Thanks for the response.  It did occur to me that 
locking/unlocking is just raising b/b^q to your own power 
r, but I agree that this seems like a weird or overly 
general way to describe the D-H key exchange so I thought 
maybe it was referring to something else.  If Ismar didn't 
make a big deal of this in class then the distinction 
probably doesn't matter.
