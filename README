This is the Kudos repository.

To compile the kernel version, you'll need a 2.6 series kernel, optionally
patched with the bio-fua, kfs-linux, and softlockup patches in the patches
directory. Then just run make.

To compile the userspace version, you'll need a recent version of FUSE
installed. Then run make -f Makefile.user. Alternately, if you create a file
called .user, you can just run make to compile first the kernel version and then
the FUSE version.

To use the kernel version, load kfs/kkfsd.ko and specify the device to attach to
in the linux_device module parameter. For example:

$ sudo insmod kfs/kkfsd.ko linux_device=/dev/sdb

Kudos will internally mount all detected file systems, but you must tell Linux
to mount the Kudos pseudo-devices (which start with kfs:). For example:

$ sudo mount kfs:/ /mnt/test -t kfs

To shut down, just unmount all kfs file systems and unload the module.

To run the userspace version, you need to copy the fuse.conf file from the conf
directory to /etc, and set a mountpoint (like /mnt/test) to be writable to your
user. Then run uukfsd.sh, specifying the file/device to attach to in the
unix_file command line option. For example:

$ ./uukfsd.sh /mnt/test unix_file=obj/fs/ext2.img

By default, the userspace version will attempt to mount all detected file
systems, including the special kfs:/dev file system. If a dev directory does not
exist within kfs:/ you will get an error which can be ignored. It's actually
probably better not to use the kfs:/dev file system anyway, since using it
incorrectly can cause kfsd to crash.

To shut down, just hit ^C to start the shut down process.
