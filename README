This is the Featherstitch repository.

To compile the kernel version, you'll need a 2.6 series kernel, optionally
patched with the bio-fua, fstitch-linux, and softlockup patches in the patches
directory. Then just run make.

To compile the userspace version, you'll need a recent version of FUSE
installed. Then run make -f Makefile.user. Alternately, if you create a file
called .user, you can just run make to compile first the kernel version and then
the FUSE version.

To use the kernel version, load fscore/kfstitchd.ko and specify the device to attach to
in the linux_device module parameter. For example:

$ sudo insmod fscore/kfstitchd.ko device=/dev/sdb

Featherstitch will internally mount all detected file systems, but you must tell Linux
to mount the Featherstitch pseudo-devices (which start with fstitch:). For example:

$ sudo mount fstitch:/ /mnt/test -t fstitch

To shut down, just unmount all fstitch file systems and unload the module.

To run the userspace version, you need to copy the fuse.conf file from the conf
directory to /etc, and set a mountpoint (like /mnt/test) to be writable to your
user. Then run uufstitchd.sh, specifying the file/device to attach to in the
unix_file command line option. For example:

$ ./uufstitchd.sh /mnt/test unix_file=obj/images/ext2.img

By default, the userspace version will attempt to mount all detected file
systems, including the special fstitch:/dev file system. If a dev directory does not
exist within fstitch:/ you will get an error which can be ignored. It's actually
probably better not to use the fstitch:/dev file system anyway, since using it
incorrectly can cause fstitchd to crash.

To shut down, just hit ^C to start the shut down process.
